\section*{Background}
Selection, both natural and artificial, is one of the major forces that
can shape the genome of living organisms and change allele frequencies.
A mutation that is beneficial for the adaptation of an organism to its
environment, or that is of agricultural or industrial interest, tends to increase in
frequency in the population, together with neighbouring genomic regions
which tend to be hitch-hiked in the process (\cite{braverman1995hitchhiking}). 
Through the last decade, the on-going genomic revolution has been making
available hundreds of thousands of genetic markers for several animal, microbial and
plant species. By looking at the allele frequency at marker loci along
the genome of populations experiencing different selective pressures, it
is possible to identify genomic regions -and ultimately genes- involved
in processes such as domestication, adaptation, evolution and artificial
selection. There are a number of methods based on allele frequencies
that have been developed to detect such signatures of selection. A
popular method is Wright's $F_{ST}$
(\cite{wright1949genetical,nei1973analysis}) that has been applied to
studies in humans (\cite{akey2002interrogating}), plants
(\cite{zhao2010genomic}) and animals (\cite{kijas2012genome}).
Alternatively, the likelihood of the difference between allele
frequencies in different populations can be estimated and used to detect
the presence of signatures of selection
(\cite{nielsen2005genomic,stella2010identification}).
However, there are several ways in which such likelihoods can be
computed, and these might differ in computation requirements and
statistical properties, such as the sensitivity to detect signals of
selection or the behaviour along the margins of the dimensional space.
It may therefore be of interest to investigate the statistical
properties of different estimators
for the likelihood of the difference between allele frequency, and
assess how well they are capable of detected actual signals of
selection.

In this study we evaluated 5 (check the number!) different ways to estimate the likelihood
of the difference in allele frequency between populations: 1) \ldots . The logarithm
of the likelihoods thus calculated were then computed and combined across sliding windows
along the genome (CLL, composite log-likelihood) in order to detect
signatures of selection. The proposed CLL approaches were finally
compared with approaches based on the $F_{ST}$ and on simple Euclidean
distances between genotypes.
The results of the study are hereby presented and discussed.

In this section we examine the growth rate of the mean of $Z_0$, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. In
addition, we examine a common modeling assumption and note the
importance of considering the tails of the extinction time $T_x$ in
studies of escape dynamics.
We will first consider the expected resistant population at $vT_x$ for
some $v>0$, (and temporarily assume $\alpha=0$)
%
\[
 E \bigl[Z_1(vT_x) \bigr]= E
\biggl[\mu T_x\int_0^{v\wedge
1}Z_0(uT_x)
\exp \bigl(\lambda_1T_x(v-u) \bigr)\,du \biggr].
\]
%
If we assume that sensitive cells follow a deterministic decay
$Z_0(t)=xe^{\lambda_0 t}$ and approximate their extinction time as
$T_x\approx-\frac{1}{\lambda_0}\log x$, then we can heuristically
estimate the expected value as
%
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqexpmuts}
E\bigl[Z_1(vT_x)\bigr] &=& \frac{\mu}{r}\log x
\int_0^{v\wedge1}x^{1-u}x^{({\lambda_1}/{r})(v-u)}\,du
\nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\mu}{r}x^{1-{\lambda_1}/{\lambda_0}v}\log x\int_0^{v\wedge
1}x^{-u(1+{\lambda_1}/{r})}\,du
\nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\mu}{\lambda_1-\lambda_0}x^{1+{\lambda_1}/{r}v} \biggl(1-\exp \biggl[-(v\wedge1) \biggl(1+
\frac{\lambda_1}{r}\biggr)\log x \biggr] \biggr).
\end{eqnarray}
%
Thus we observe that this expected value is finite for all $v>0$ (also see \cite{koon,khar,zvai,xjon,marg}).
